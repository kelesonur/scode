# Welcome to SCODE!

SCODE (Workshop on Open-Source Coding for Social Science) is a project by Onur Keleş and Ömer Bayraklı that aims to teach data science with Python and R to students from a social science background. The first edition of SCODE was completed in Summer 2022 at Yıldız Technical University and the second and most recent edition ended in Spring 2013 at Boğaziçi University, hosting more than 100 students, 5 guest lecturers and over 12 weeks of training. We collected all the training materials on this Github bookdown, free to use or re-produce. Enjoy the content!
